<h1> Java OOP Project for College Course </h1>

The professor who taught this course at my university had a bad reputation of not passing people through the course.
When I heard this I said "Alright bet!" and challenged the professor even tho i didnt know anything about Java.
I think he liked my attitude towards him so he challenged me too. TL:DR I smashed the challenge and passed with 100 score

Story time over. TY for reading :d
